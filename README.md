# Introduction of the project
The aim of this project is to implement and analyze various optimization algorithms, studied during
the optimization course on a real-world dataset. The dataset, sourced from kaggle, focuses on the
classification of banana quality, where features such as softness, size, and other measurable attributes
are used to predict whether the bananas are of good or bad quality.
By applying different optimization techniques to this classification task, we will evaluate their performance in terms of convergence rate, computational efficiency, and accuracy. The key performance
metrics will include the number of iterations (steps) required for convergence, execution time, accuracy of the classification, and the overall computational complexity of each algorithm. The final
analysis will provide insights into the effectiveness of these optimization approaches in handling real-world classification problems.
